## Versioning
I hate astrology[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac], so I'm using the Zodiac
signs for major releases. Hence, the schedule, which I don't expect to get far
down will be:
  1. __Aries__ (current)
  2. Taurus
  3. Gemini
  4. Cancer
  5. Leo
  6. Virgo
  7. Libra
  8. Scorpio
  9. Sagittarius
  10. Capricorn
  11. Aquarius
  12. Pisces
